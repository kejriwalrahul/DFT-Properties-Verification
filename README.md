# DFT-Properties-Verification

This project generates DFT of random sinusoids and studies the properties of DFT using them. 

##Usage
1. `make 1a` for generating random sinusoids and computing frequency from no of zero crossings. 
2. `make 1b` to obtain the DFT spectrum of generated sinusoids and computing frequency from spectrum. 
3. `make 2a` to verify superposition theorem for DFT signals.
4. `make 2b` to verify convolution property for DFT signals.
5. `make 2d` to verify Parseval's theorem and circular shift property for DFT signals.
